             - a function selecting the analysis information inside a symbol.
             - a function selecting the synthesis information inside a symbol.
             - a function that reconstructs the symbol from analysis and synthesis information (will be used by LZGenerate).

output:

a LZ continuation tree
a LZ pattern tree

LZify takes a list of anything considered as an ordered sequence.
It then builds a pattern dictionary that encodes patterns of various lengths
discovered over this sequence, as well as the conditional probabilities
that a certain pattern be followed by certain elements
If niter is greater than 1, the analysis of the sequence is iterated <niter> times,
each time skipping the next element on the left of the sequence.
niter > 1 increases the number of patterns discovered. It is equivalent to analyzing
a longer sequence, thus increasing the statistical properties (redundancy).
Empirical experience shows that niter = 4 is good value for such data as bach-like counterpoint
or jazz chorus.
Then LZify builds the continuation tree. This tree is another representation of the pattern
dictionary, suited to generation features : the branch are reversed, in order to ease the search
for the maximum context, and the continuations of each context are explicitly represented, linked
with their corresponding probabilities.

inputs :

dict: a PST generated by the PSTify function.
Length: integer, >=1.  length of the sequence to be generated.
minPast: integer, >=0.  minimum length of the context.
incipit1: list. a sequence of analysis symboles that will be the beginning of the generated analysis sequence.
incipit2: list. a sequence of synthesis symboles that will be the beginning of the generated synthesis sequence.
reconstr: the name of a function that reconstructs the symbol from analysis and synthesis information. If nil, the predefined (in LZify) fonction will be used.
strategy: the name of function that chooses new synthesis information according to its last evolution.
constraints: constraint function of the last generated analysis information and last generated sequence, both reversed.
equiv1: the name of function that compares a symbole at the root of the tree with the last generated one.
equiv2: the name of function that compares a symbole with any in the tree.

output :

a list of events in the same alphabet as the analyzed sequence.

After building a pattern dictionary using PSTify, PSTGenerate may be used to
generate a new sequence that imitates the statistical behaviour encoded into the dictionary.
If a list of <something> had been analyzed by PSTify, the result will be a new list of <something>.
At a every point of the generation, PSTGenerate looks at the longest sequence of last generated elements
that belongs to the PST.
It then checks the conditional probabilities associated with
that pattern (or context) , then generates a new element with regard to the probability. It then adds
this element to the right of the generated sequence, and iterates.

If, at a certain point of the generation, the length of the context is lower than minPast, then PSTGenerate
goes back one step before and generates another symbols until it respects the minPast constraint. It may
go back as far as necessa
ry. If no sequence can respect the constraint, PSTGenerate returns nil.
Thanks to the minPast parameter, you can prevent PSTGenerate from generating with no or little context.

   "Generates a new sequence following the model of a given LZ continuation tree (generated by the LZify function).

inputs :

dict: a LZ continuation tree generated by the LZify function.
maxPast: nil or integer.  maximum length of the context. If nil : no maximum past constraint.
Length: integer, >=1.  length of the sequence to be generated.
mostprobable: if not true, inverse all the probability distributions (the less probable one becomes the most probable one).
minPast: integer, >=0.  minimum length of the context.
minComplex: integer, >=0.  minimum size of the subLZtree of each context.
incipit1: list. a sequence of analysis symboles that will be the beginning of the generated analysis sequence.
incipit2: list. a sequence of synthesis symboles that will be the beginning of the generated synthesis sequence.
reconstr: the name of a function that reconstructs the symbol from analysis and synthesis information. If nil, the predefined (in LZify) fonction will be used.
strategy: the name of function that chooses new synthesis information according to its last evolution.
constraints: constraint function of the last generated analysis information and last generated sequence, both reversed.
equiv1: the name of function that compares a symbole at the root of the tree with the last generated one.
equiv2: the name of function that compares a symbole with any in the tree.

output :

a list of events in the same alphabet as the analyzed sequence.

After building a pattern dictionary using LZify, LZGenerate may be used to
generate a new sequence that imitates the statistical behaviour encoded into the dictionary.
If a list of <something> had been analyzed by LZify, the result will be a new list of <something>.
At a every point of the generation, LZGenerate looks at the longest sequence of last generated elements
that belongs to the LZ tree (even those that do not start exactly from the root).
It then checks the conditional probabilities associated with
that pattern (or context) , then generates a new element with regard to the probability. It then adds
this element to the right of the generated sequence, and iterates.

If maxPast in an integer, the length of the context must not exceed maxPast. That is to say, this
limits the size of the memory of what LZGenerate has previously generated.

If, at a certain point of the generation, the length of the context is lower than minPast, then LZGenerate
goes back one step before and generates another symbols until it respects the minPast constraint. It may
go back as far as necessa
ry. If no sequence can respect the constraint, LZGenerate returns nil.
Thanks to the minPast parameter, you can prevent LZGenerate from generating with no or little context.

If, at a certain point of the generation, the number of all the nodes of the tree that can be reached from now on
(which is called the subtree generated by the present context) is lower than minComplex, then LZGenerate 
takes into account not only the continuation of the longest context, but also those of more little context,
this in order to get out of this subtree. Thanks to the minContext parameter, you can prevent LZGenerate
from getting stuck inside a little subtree.

The cross-alphabet sequence is a list containing sublists of the form : (... ((c1 c2 ... cn) d) ...)
where the ci are either 0 (empty canal) or a list of the form (p1 p2 ... pm)
where the pi are pitches in midicents
and d is a duration in ms.
Each of this sublist encodes a polyphonic slice, containing a set of canals - which are sets of superposed pitches -
and lasting for a certain duration. The concatenation of all these slices
is musically equal to the original midi sequence.

This representation captures the essentials of the polyphonic/rythmic structure of
the midifile. It is thus convenient to be given as input to the  LZify function
if you want to build a statistical model of a polyphonic piece from a midifile.
If you use then LZgenerate or its variants to generate an improvisation of the piece, you'll get again
a pitch/duration cross-alphabet sequence. Then you'll need a function such as cross->chordseq
to put your data back into a musical form.

Filters are designed to simplify the alphabet of symbols and the dictionnary of patterns :

- Each time a new note is activated, the legato filter inspects the continuation of the sequence
until the release of this note or until <legatime> msec. Any note that has been activated before
the new note and that is released during the inspected part will then be released just when the
new note is activated. Therefore, this filter discards intermediate states where two juxtaposed
notes are superimposed during a very short time. 

- Each time a new note is activated, the arpeggio filter inspects the continuation of the sequence
until <arpegtime> msec. Any note that was due to be activated during the inspected part will in
fact be activated just when the former note is activated. Thus, this filter synchronizes arpeggios.

- Each time a note is released, the release synchro filter synchronizes all the following releases
- until the activation of a new note or until <releastime> msec - at the date of the first release. 
Thus, this filter synchronizes note releases.

- The staccato filter removes each release period, between two played periods, that lasts less than
<staccatime> msec.

Finally, the duration of each symbol is quantified with the help of an OMKant Library function :
make-regular. This function accepts one particular parameter, here <toltime>, which specifies the
percentage of error that is tolerated during the quantization.

- Each time a note is released, the release synchro filter synchronizes all the following releases
- until the activation of a new note or until <releastime> msec - at the date of the first release. 
Thus, this filter synchronizes note releases.

- The staccato filter removes each release period, between two played periods, that lasts less than
<staccatime> msec.

Finally, the duration of each symbol is quantified with the help of an OMKant Library function :
make-regular. This function accepts one particular parameter, here <toltime>, which specifies the
percentage of error that is tolerated during the quantization.
